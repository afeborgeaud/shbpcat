Computation of epicentral distance catalog for the backward-propagated SH wavefield using the Direct solution method (DSM; Kawai et al., 2006). See Supplementary Information of [Borgeaud et al. (2019)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JB016924) for details. This code has to be used in conjunction with [Kibrary](https://github.com/kensuke1984/Kibrary/tree/anselme). See [here](https://github.com/kensuke1984/Kibrary/wiki/Tutorial-for-waveform-inversion) for a quick tutorial.
